# Italian translation of [AwSW][1]

## Status

Just started, currently working on the non-story-related files.

## How can I participate?

1. To start, have a look at the pinned threads in the dedicated [Steam sub-forum][2]; there you'll also find the Italian translation thread.
2. You can contact me either through [Steam][3] or [Discord][4], so that I can add you as a collaborator and we can discuss how to divide up the tasks, but in the meantime feel free to poke around to get an idea or even start working on the translation on your own.
3. If you don't feel like working on the actual translation, you can still provide a precious contribution by reviewing the already translated files and report errors/suggest improvements, either by contacting me directly or by posting on the [discussions][5] here.
4. Should you need contextual reference while translating/reviewing, you can find the game's relevant source code in this [Onedrive folder][6], together with other stuff like images containing text that needs to be translated, too.

I should probably mention that this is intended to be an 'official' translation until proven otherwise, so if you want to give your contribution then you agree to transfer all rights on said translation to the developer (except maybe for the attribution right, but it remains at their discretion) so that it may be included in the game without legal issues.
