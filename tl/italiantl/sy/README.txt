The file "a chimera's ivory nuts-aw2.jpg" is named because it is a hint for a puzzle - it is an anagram for "Marcus the Visionary", which lets us realize that Marcus is the Visionary refered to in another hint of the puzzle - "The Visionary's Vice".

As such, this file should be translated in a similar manner - it needs to look like a regular phrase or expression (but maybe seems a bit suspicious or out of place), but is an anagram to whatever "Marcus the visionary" translates to in your language.

For the Marcus image, you can add the writing in your language to the source image (It reads "What do you think?" - Marcus), then create the glitchy appearence of it yourself, or with a tool like this one:

The text/name shouldn't be too easily readable in the glitched state, which is why I made it so that it is broken up into multiple pieces.

The file "oxn dswoc-aw3.jpg" is a hint to solve the secret ending puzzle and can be shuffled to a caesar cipher to "end times". It may be necessary to change this puzzle for some translations, but ideally we'd be able to have an encoded word that can be less than 9 characters long.
